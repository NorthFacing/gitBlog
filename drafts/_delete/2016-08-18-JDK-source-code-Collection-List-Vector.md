## Vector

Vector是Java遗留类，一般情况下，Vector能实现的功能，都可以用ArrayList类实现。
两者最大的区别是：Vector是线程安全，ArrayList非线程安全。

ArrayList 和 Vector 具体区别如下：

num|ArrayList | Vector
---|---|---
1) |  ArrayList is not synchronized. | Vector is synchronized.
2) |  ArrayList increments 50% of current array size if number of element exceeds from its capacity. | Vector increments 100% means doubles the array size if total number of element exceeds than its capacity.
3) |  ArrayList is not a legacy class, it is introduced in JDK 1.2. | Vector is a legacy class.
4) |  ArrayList is fast because it is non-synchronized. | Vector is slow because it is synchronized i.e. in multithreading environment, it will hold the other threads in runnable or non-runnable state until current thread releases the lock of object.
5) |  ArrayList uses Iterator interface to traverse the elements. | Vector uses Enumeration interface to traverse the elements. But it can use Iterator also.
